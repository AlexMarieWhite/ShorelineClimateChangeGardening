        <p>Xeriscaping is a landscaping approach that focuses on creating beautiful and sustainable gardens while minimizing water usage. Derived from the Greek word "xeros," meaning "dry," xeriscaping is one strategy for making your home more climate resilient in years to come, especially during summer season when rainfall events are scarce. This method of gardening is focused on designing your environment for water conservation without sacrificing the beauty and functionality of outdoor spaces.</p>

          <div class="tab-content">
            <p><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Xeriscaping can reduce water usage for landscaping by up to 50-75%, leading to significant water savings.</p>
            <p><strong>Beautification:</strong>Diversity in plants and flowers can bring additional beauty to your home. As well, it may offer enjoyment in floral arrangements.</p>

            <p><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Lower water bills and reduced maintenance expenses contribute to cost savings for homeowners.</p>
            <p><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> Xeriscaping reduces the strain on local water resources and promotes a more sustainable approach to gardening.</p>
            <p><strong>Biodiversity and Habitat:</strong> Using native plants supports local ecosystems and provides habitats for pollinators and wildlife.</p>
            <p><strong>Climate Resilience:</strong> Xeriscaped gardens are better equipped to withstand droughts and other climate challenges.</p>

        <div class="tab-content">
          <p><strong>Water Efficiency:</strong> Xeriscaping emphasizes the use of drought-tolerant plants that require minimal irrigation once established. This reduces water consumption significantly compared to traditional landscaping.</p>
          <p><strong>Soil Improvement:</strong> Good soil structure and drainage are crucial for xeriscaping success. Amending the soil with compost or organic matter enhances water retention and nutrient availability for plants.</p>
          <p><strong>Appropriate Plant Selection:</strong> Native plants and species adapted to the local climate are preferred in xeriscaping. These plants are well-suited to the region's conditions and require less water to thrive.</p>
          <p><strong>Mulching:</strong> Applying mulch around plants helps retain soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and regulates soil temperature, reducing the need for frequent watering.</p>
          <p><strong>Efficient Irrigation:</strong> Drip irrigation, soaker hoses, and other efficient watering methods deliver water directly to plant roots, minimizing wastage due to evaporation or runoff.</p>
          <p><strong>Hardscaping:</strong> Incorporating non-plant elements like gravel, rocks, and pathways reduces the need for extensive plantings and conserves water.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular maintenance practices, such as proper pruning, weeding, and pest control, ensure the health and vitality of xeriscaped gardens.</p>

          <p>Above is an example of a xeriscape garden located in Shoreline. This garden is themed to be a woodland zen garden. This xeriscaped garden incorporates native grasses, drought tolerant shrubs, Japanese maples, and decorative basalt rocks that were gotten from OfferUp for free. This yard used to simply be grass. Now, this yard is climate-friendly and thrives with bunnies, birds, and squirrels.</p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p><strong>Choose Native Plants:</strong> Select plants that are native to the Pacific Northwest region. Native plants are well adapted to the local climate, soil, and rainfall patterns. Some recommendations include orange agoseris, red columbine, roemer's fescue, and swamp onion.</p>
        <img src="img/xeriscapeflowers.svg" alt="A picture of native plants recommended above.">
        <p><strong>Group Plants by Water Needs:</strong> Group plants with similar water requirements together. This ensures efficient watering and prevents overwatering or underwatering.</p>
        <p><strong>Improve Soil Quality:</strong> Enhance soil structure and drainage by amending with compost or organic matter before planting.</p>
        <p><strong>Mulch:</strong> Apply a layer of mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Mulching can be done as infrequently as every 3-5 years to retain weed supression benefits. For a climate- and cost-friendly option, consider using arbor chips from Chip Drop or call a local arborist company, they will oftentimes drop a load of arbor chips to your home for free.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficient Irrigation:</strong> Use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to deliver water directly to plant roots, minimizing water loss through evaporation.</p>
        <p><strong>Limit Turf Area:</strong> Reduce or eliminate traditional lawn areas in favor of drought-resistant ground covers, gravel, or native grasses. Some ground cover recommendations for pathways include native heucheras, wild ginger (asarum caudatum), and coastal strawberry (gragaria chiloensis).</p>
        <p><strong>Consider Hardscaping:</strong> Incorporate paths, patios, and rock features to add visual interest and reduce the need for water-intensive plantings. If you are willing to wait, oftentimes you can find posts on OfferUp and NextDoor of people looking to give away rocks and stepping stones for free or low-cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Plan for Sun and Shade:</strong> Plant sun-loving species in sunny areas and shade-tolerant species in areas with less light.</p>
        <p><strong>Regular Maintenance:</strong> While xeriscaped gardens require less maintenance, occasional weeding, pruning, and monitoring for pests are still important.</p>
